It does not use module variables, so it should be good for parallel execution.\n\nThe algorithm used in this library is the simple template matching of PIV (particle image velocimetry) for monochromatic image-like data, but the matching is conducted multiple times in a Lagrangian manner as in PTV (particle tracking velocimetry) over a number of times specified by the parameter named ntrac. The default scoring method for template matching is the cross correlation coefficient, as in the basic PIV. Both forward and backward tracking is available. Use the parameter itstep; tracking is backward along time sequence, if it is negative.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Available-scoring-methods","page":"Home","title":"Available scoring methods","text":"XCOR: cross-correlation, cov(x',y')/sig(x)/sig(y), where x represents the template sub-image and y represents the target sub-image that are slided.\nNCOV: normalized covariance, cov(x',y')/sig(x)^2: covariance normalized the variance of the template sub-image x.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Screening","page":"Home","title":"Screening","text":"A check (result screening) based on velocity change along trajectory is available (by using the threshold parameter named vxch and vych), so it is recommended to always set ntrac >= 2.
